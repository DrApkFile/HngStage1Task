# Number Classification API

This is a **Node.js + Express** API that classifies a number and returns its mathematical properties (e.g., prime, perfect, Armstrong, odd/even) along with a fun fact about the number fetched from the [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/).

## Features
- Accepts a number as input and classifies it.
- Determines if the number is:
  - **Prime**
  - **Perfect**
  - **Armstrong**
  - **Odd or Even**
- Calculates the sum of the digits of the number.
- Fetches a fun fact about the number from the Numbers API.
- Returns a well-structured JSON response.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for JavaScript.
- **Express**: Web framework for building the API.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for fetching data from the Numbers API.
- **CORS**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **Git**: Version control system.
- **GitHub**: Hosting the repository.

## API Endpoint
### `GET /api/classify-number`
#### Query Parameters
- `number` (required): The number to classify.

#### Example Request

GET http://localhost:3000/api/classify-number?number=371




## Request and Response Examples
### Success Response (200 OK)
```json
{
  "number": 371,
  "is_prime": false,
  "is_perfect": false,
  "properties": ["armstrong", "odd"],
  "digit_sum": 11,
  "fun_fact": "371 is an Armstrong number because 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371"
}
```

### Error Response (400 Bad Request)
```json
{
  "number": "alphabet",
  "error": true
}
```
